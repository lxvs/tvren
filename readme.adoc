= Tvren - A Rename Utility

Tvren is a batch script to rename files or directories.  It is far from the best but better than `ren` command in Windows cmd.exe, except that it cannot rename a file or directory to a name that is same but in different case.

== Questions May be Frequently Asked

=== Does it use regex?

No, it does not make use of regex, just does something that can also be done with `ren` command in cmd.exe, but more easily, for example, adding prefix/suffix for files or directories matching a pattern, substituting part of the filename with something different.

=== Why called tvren?

It is named as _tvren_ because it was originally written for renaming a large amount of TV show episodes from, such as, _S01E01_ to _1x01_.

=== Why batch instead of shell script?

Personally I prefer shell scripts much more, but batch script in Windows can rename cloud files in OneDrive without downloading them.
